# docsplit_images

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jameshuynh/docsplit_images)

Docsplit images is used to convert a document file (pdf, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, doc, docx, etc...) to a list of images combining with famous paperclip gem at [https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip](paperclip)

## Installation

### Install Docsplit gem dependency (Referring from [http://documentcloud.github.com/docsplit/](http://documentcloud.github.com/docsplit/))
  
#### 1. Install GraphicsMagick. Its ‘gm’ command is used to generate images. Either compile it from source, or use a package manager:

```bash
[aptitude | port | brew] install graphicsmagick
```

#### 2. Install Poppler. On Linux, use aptitude, apt-get or yum:

```bash
aptitude install poppler-utils poppler-data
```

On Mac, you can install from source or use MacPorts:

```bash
sudo port install poppler | brew install poppler
```

#### 3. (Optional) Install Ghostscript:

```bash
[aptitude | port | brew] install ghostscript
```

Ghostscript is required to convert PDF and Postscript files. 

#### 4. (Optional) Install Tesseract:

```bash
[aptitude | port | brew] install [tesseract | tesseract-ocr]
```

Without Tesseract installed, you'll still be able to extract text from documents, but you won't be able to automatically OCR them. 

#### 5. (Optional) Install pdftk. On Linux, use aptitude, apt-get or yum:

```bash
aptitude install pdftk
```
	
On the Mac, you can download a [http://www.pdflabs.com/docs/install-pdftk/](recent installer for the binary). Without pdftk installed, you can use Docsplit, but won't be able to split apart a multi-page PDF into single-page PDFs. 

#### 6. (Optional) Install OpenOffice. On Linux, use aptitude, apt-get or yum:
  
```bash
aptitude install openoffice.org openoffice.org-java-common
```  

On Mac, download and install [http://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html](http://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html).

### Install Gem

	gem 'docsplit_images', :git => 'https://github.com/jameshuynh/docsplit_images.git', tag: "v0.2.4"

## Setting Up
	
From terminal, type the command to install
	
```bash
bundle
rails g docsplit_images <table_name> <attachment_field_name>
# e.g. rails generate docsplit_images asset document
rake db:migrate
```

In your model:

```ruby
class Asset < ActiveRecord::Base
  ...
  attr_accessible :mydocument
  has_attached_file :mydocument
  docsplit_images_conversion_for :mydocument, {size: "800x"}
  ...
end
```

## Processing Images

docsplit_images requires sidekiq to be turned on the process. 

	[bundle exec] sidekiq

While it is processing using [https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job](delayed_job), you can check if it is processing by accessing attribute ``is_processing_image``

```ruby
asset.is_processing_image?
```

## Total number of pages

* If your document file is not PDF, this will be non-zero after the internal conversion to PDF has been completed. 

```ruby
asset.number_of_images_entry
```

## Checking the number of images which has been completed

```ruby
asset.number_of_completed_images
```

## Checking the overall conversion progress

```ruby
asset.images_conversion_progress
# => 0.45 (which is 45%)
```

## Accessing list of images using ``document_images_list``

``document_images_list`` will return a list of URL of images converting from the document

```ruby
asset.document_images_list
# => ["/system/myfile_revisions/files/000/000/019/images/SBA_Admin_workflow_1.png", "/system/myfile_revisions/files/000/000/019/images/SBA_Admin_workflow_2.png", ...]
```
